# EOSC interoperability framework: report from the EOSC Executive Board Working Groups FAIR and Architecture.
European Commission. Directorate General for Research and Innovation., EOSC Executive Board<h2>Abstract</h2>
	This document has been developed by the Interoperability Task Force of the EOSC Executive Board FAIR Working Group, with participation from the Architecture WG. Achieving interoperability within EOSC is essential in order for the federation of services that will compose EOSC to provide added value for service users. In the context of the FAIR principles, interoperability is discussed in relation to the fact that “research data usually need to be integrated with other data; in addition, the data need to interoperate with applications or workflows for analysis, storage, and processing”. Our view on interoperability does not only consider data but also the many other research artefacts that may be used in the context of research activity, such as software code, scientific workflows, laboratory protocols, open hardware designs, etc. It also considers the need to make services and e-infrastructures as interoperable as possible. This document identifies the general principles that should drive the creation of the EOSC Interoperability Framework (EOSC IF), and organises them into the four layers that are commonly considered in other interoperability frameworks (e.g., the European Interoperability Framework - EIF): technical, semantic, organisational and legal interoperability. For each of these layers, a catalogue of problems and needs, as well as challenges and high-level recommendations have been proposed, which should be considered in the further development and implementation of the EOSC IF components. Such requirements and recommendations have been developed after an extensive review of related literature as well as by running interviews with stakeholders from ERICs (European Research Infrastructure Consortia), ESFRI (European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures) projects, service providers and research communities. Some examples of such requirements are: “every semantic artefact that is being maintained in EOSC must have sufficient associated documentation, with clear examples of usage and conceptual diagrams”, or “Coarse-grained and fine-grained dataset (and other research object) search tools need to be made available”, etc. The document finally contains a proposal for the management of FAIR Digital Objects in the context of EOSC and a reference architecture for the EOSC Interoperability Framework that is inspired by and extends the European Interoperability Reference Architecture (EIRA), identifying the main building blocks required.

	The European Open Science Cloud (EOSC)5 is a European Commission initiative aiming at developing a federated infrastructure providing its users with services promoting Open Science practices. EOSC aims to support three objectives: (1) to increase the value of scientific data assets by making them easily available to a larger number of researchers, across disciplines (interdisciplinarity) and borders (EU added value) and (2) to reduce the costs of scientific data management, while (3) ensuring adequate protection of information/personal data according to applicable EU rules.

Este recunoscut faptul că datele de cercetare, de regulă, trebuie să fie integrate cu alte date, dar ce înseamnă acest lucru pare a fi lăsat la nivelul înțelegerii fiecăruia.<br>

	the role of interoperability frameworks is to “define community practices for data sharing, data formats, metadata standards, tools and infrastructure, recognising the objectives and cultures of different research communities”.

	That is, metadata is a kind of data: data may act as metadata when the descriptive relationship is revealed between the data (now metadata) and the target object(s). And metadata that is the same for more than one object is metadata for a class of objects...”

	There is no commonly agreed definition for semantic artefact, although a working definition is provided by Coen16 as “the tools which allow humans and machines to locate, access and understand (meta)data, [..] including ontologies, knowledge organisation systems, data vocabularies, code lists, etc.”.

	“a machine-actionable and -readable formalisation of a conceptualisation enabling sharing and reuse by humans and machines. These artefacts may have a broad range of formalisation, from loose set of terms, taxonomies, thesauri to higher-order logics. Moreover, semantic artefacts are serialised using a variety of digital representation formats, e.g., RDF Turtle, OWL-RDF, XML, JSONLD

<h3><mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Citat</mark></h3>
	Semantic interoperability can be defined as “the ability of computer systems to transmit data with unambiguous, shared meaning. Semantic interoperability is a requirement to enable machine computable logic, inferencing, knowledge discovery, and data federation between information systems”.

<h3><mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Citat</mark></h3>
	All communities should generate clear and precise definitions for the concepts that they use, as well as their metadata and data schemas. These definitions should be publicly available, referenced by a persistent identifier and shared in EOSC. Furthermore, a classification for research disciplines (e.g., The German Research Foundation’s subject area classification46 or Frascati manual47) should be also explicitly chosen and implemented within the EOSC context.

<h3><mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Citat</mark></h3>
	EOSC should provide support for the maintenance of a repository of semantic artefacts, and a governance framework for such a repository. For example, SKOS thesauri may be maintained using services similar to the CESSDA Vocabulary Service.
